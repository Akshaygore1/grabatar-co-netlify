# Grabatar 

What is it? Well you first need to know what Gravatar is (and was) - <https://gravatar.com/> 
Gravatar was a way to have an avatar/DP/profile-pic for anyone with an email id

The URL for gravatar (and later libravatar) was around using an MD5 sum for the email. 

The idea with `grabatar.co` is to remove the md5 complexity and make it accessible to find a profile pic simply using the email id in the URL. 

Today you can use it like this ðŸ‘‰ <https://grabatar.co/championswimmer@gmail.com>
